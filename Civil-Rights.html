        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-3"> The Civil Rights Movement was a pivotal social and political movement in the United States that spanned from the 1950s to the 1960s. It aimed to end racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans, and it sought to secure their constitutional rights and equal treatment under the constitutional law.</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1" data-animation-name="customAnimationIn" data-animation-duration="1000"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A significant event that changed the lives of the African Americans in the United States in the early 20th century was the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Firstly, the NAACP lobbied aggressively for the passage of a federal law that would prohibit lynching. In 1916, the NAACP advocated for anti-lynching legislation and formed a special committee to bring public awareness to the cause of anti-lynching. In 1918, after the NAACP’s efforts to support the Dyer Bill, which “Assure[s] to persons within the jurisdiction of every State the equal protection of the laws, and to punish the crime of lynching.” The NAACP also convinced President Woodrow Wilson and other politicians to condemn mob violence towards African Americans. This evoked change in the lives of African Americans, as lynching is now illegal and punishable by law, but this would go on for another half century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Additionally, the NAACP further helped to fight against segregation in the schools of the United States. The NAACP helped write a report and laid the foundation to a legal strategy to attack southern school segregation. Nathan Margold, a NAACP lawyer, proposed a legal plan by attacking the doctrine of separate but equal by challenging the inherent inequality of segregation in publicly funded primary and secondary schools. Charles Hamilton Houston, another NAACP attorney, sought to fight for the rights of African Americans.&nbsp; He played a pivotal role in nearly every Supreme Court civil rights case in the two decades before the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. In 1938, a Supreme Court case with regard to a black man’s admission to the University of Missouri, Houston argued that it was unconstitutional to deny African Americans admission to a university as there weren't any “separate but equal” facilities. With Houston’s efforts and contributions,&nbsp; the Brown v Board of Education of 1954 ruled that&nbsp; “State-sanctioned segregation of public schools was a violation of the 14th amendment and was therefore unconstitutional”. Clearly seen above, NAACP’s efforts for desegregation, and their efforts for anti-lynching policies, has changed the lives of many African Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Furthermore, the NAACP fought for justice and to protect the African American communities. On 28 August 1955, Emmett Till, a 14 year old African American boy was kidnapped and brutally killed for whistling at a white woman. His mangled body was found with a cotton gin fan tied to his neck and was found in the bottom of a river on 31 August. The NAACP quickly issued a press release the day after the body was recovered. Even with all the evidence, an all-white jury acquitted Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, the two white men accused of Emmett Till’s lynching. Shortly after, the NAACP organised mass demonstrations nationwide, and invited Emmett Till’s mother as a guest speaker. Even though the 2 men responsible for Emmett Till’s death were not charged, the growing public cry for federal protection of civil rights led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Through NAACP, they were able to evoke change and protect the rights of African Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This clearly indicates that the NAACP has changed the lives of the African Americans in the United States with their legal support and actions towards the African Americans.&nbsp;</b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Key events that helped to change the attitude of American presidents towards discrimination in the south revolved around public protests which were publicised in the media.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Firstly, on December 1 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man, and shortly after she was arrested. This spurred the public and sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The Bus Boycott lasted for over a year, and ended with the US Supreme Court stating that “Bus segregation violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment”, which led to the successful end of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. From the public actions and protests against discrimination, it led to change in the views of the Supreme Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Additionally, throughout the next decade, many public protests and riots were publicised across the United States, and increased the public awareness of discrimination. Events such as the Freedom Buses further increased people’s awareness, and changed people’s views against discrimination. On 14 May 1961, a group of freedom riders rode to Anniston, Alabama, bus station shortly after 1 pm, they found the building locked. Then a group of 50 white men led by KKK leader William Chapel armed with pipes, chains and other weapons smashed windows, slashed tires, and dented the sides of the Rider’s bus. After the first assault, the police pretended to escort the bus to safety, but then abandoned the bus just outside the Anniston City Limits. This resulted in a second attack by another white mob, they broke windows, and a member managed to toss a firebomb through a broken window. The mob attempted to trap the Riders in the bus, but they fled when the fuel tank exploded, this allowed the Rider to escape the flames and smoke through the bus windows and main door, only to be attacked and beaten by the mob outside. This was one of the many freedom rides, some were less violent than the others, but the end goal was clear, to desegregate buses. On 1 November 1961, the ICC ruled that “Segregation on interstate buses and facilities was illegal” took effect. Through the actions of the freedom riders, and through the media publicising the protests and riots, it brought change to the laws, and changed the attitude of many people towards discrimination and segregation.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Furthermore, the mass demonstration and protest in Washington DC was a turning point of the Civil Rights Movement. The protest was to spotlight the inequalities and press for a new federal jobs program, and there were also calls for congressional passage of the Civil Rights Acts. Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream” speech in 1963 was the turning point of the Civil Rights Movement. President Kennedy was reluctant to push ahead with the Civil Rights Act, but after the march and protest in Washington DC, the administration was forced to act. On July 2 1964 President Lyndon B. Johnson officially signed the Civil Rights Act into law. As seen, these events have changed the attitudes of John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson towards discrimination, and initiated change in the laws of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This clearly demonstrates that public protests and riots that were publicised in the media brought forward change. And this further helped the African American community, as their lives were changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1" data-animation-name="customAnimationIn" data-animation-duration="1000">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Throughout the late 20th century, there was continuity of the civil rights movement even after in the Post-Civil Rights movement era. The passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 were seen as the final blows to segregation and discrimination in the United States. Slowly, the Civil Rights movements started to decline. However, there were still organisations and people who kept pursuing change and pushing for the continuity of the civil rights movement.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Jesse Jackson was an African American civil rights leader, he spoke out against discrimination across the world. Before he was the leader, he went on marches with Martin Luther King Jr, and he founded the Chicago branch of the “Operation Breadbasket”, which was the economic arm of the SCLC. During his time as a leader, he advocated for black self-help and achieved a broad audience for his liberal views. In 1984, he established the National Rainbow Coalition, which sought equal rights for African Americans, women, and homosexuals. Jesse Jackson also visited South Africa to speak against the Apartheid, and he also campaigned in the Middle East to give Palestinians their own state. This shows that there were still leaders and continuity even in the Post Civil Rights Movement Era.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Furthermore, there are organisations that kept pursuing and pushing for the continuity of the Civil Rights movement. For example, the NAACP kept fighting for justice, as seen from the publication of The search for military Justice (1971), where the NAACP fought for justice on behalf of African Americans Military Servicemen. The Defense Department adopted recommendations from the report as guidelines to improve racial relations in the Armed Services. Moreover, the NAACP also chartered its own prison branch. The NAACP prison branches sponsored educational instruction, job training, incentive awards, fundraising activities, and entertainment. The NAACP prisons housed high numbers of blacks and other minorities, and reduced the rate of inmate recidivism. This improved the lives of the African Americans in prison, and further benefited the society as the rate of inmate recidivism decreased dramatically. Additionally, the NAACP initiated programs to increase employment opportunities, and to strengthen minority entrepreneurship. One of such programs was the Operation Fair Share Program, administered by the NAACP Development Department. The program would encourage more job opportunities and other economic benefits for African Americans, and to improve the lives of them. Some corporations in the Operation Fair Share Program were Georgia Power Company, General Motors, McDonald’s Corporation. This clearly demonstrates that there was still continuity in the Civil Rights Movement even after its decline.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In addition to that, there were still protest movements against discrimination throughout the Post Civil rights movement Era. One of such protests was the 1989 Silent March. On 26 August 1989, the NAACP organised a silent protest against the actions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided that they were to reverse decades of legal progress for women and minorities, and hence, the NAACP organised a protest in Washington DC. The NAACP President had estimated the crowd at 135,000 people, but according to Police Reports only 35,000 people participated in the Silent March, and 18,500 people gathered at the west facade of the Capitol for a post-march rally and speeches. One of the many cases the Silent March was protesting against was the Wards Cove vs. Antonio case, where the Civil Rights group claimed that it had set back and reversed&nbsp; 18 years of precedent and placed the entire burden of proof of discrimination on the victim. After all these Supreme Court decisions, the NAACP organised the Silent March, and hence, there are still protests movements against discrimination in the Post Civil rights movement Era.&nbsp;<br></b>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>This clearly indicates that there was continuity in the Civil Rights Movement even after its decline, and there were people and organisations continuing to fight for change.&nbsp;<br></b>

                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2" data-animation-name="customAnimationIn" data-animation-duration="1000"><b>&nbsp;In conclusion, to a large extent, the Civil Rights Movement can be evaluated to demonstrate more change in the Twentieth Century as the living conditions of the African Americans in the United States changed drastically from the start of the Twentieth Century, and many constitutional laws have been changed to protect the rights of the African Americans in the United States through the actions of the citizens, and organisations such as the NAACP have been supporting, helping and changing the ways of living for coloured people in the United States.&nbsp;</b>
