                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, the movie was based on the book The Clansmen written by Thomas Dixon Jr., an advocate for white supremacy and a friend of President Woodrow Wilson. The Birth of a Nation became the first blockbuster movie and made $60 million dollars in profit for the studio (Nearly a billion today). The stars of the 1920s became household names and everybody wanted to read about them in magazines. The movie became the first movie to be screened at the White House, therefore reaching a wide audience.The movie poses Black people as dangerous and violent, it shows newly freed slaves rampaging, aiming to rape white women. The movie also uses film techniques such as close-up shots of black characters, who were actually just white actors in black face. These angles were meant to emphasise and show the physical differences between black and white people. This highlights the filmmakers belief that skin colour made Black people fundamentally different from white ones. The film inspired William Joseph Simmons, a racist war veteran, to start researching the first Klan of the KKK. He started advertising and inviting men into his new Ku Klux Klan to terrorise Black people and immigrants.<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Additionally, the movie praised the Ku Klux Klan, one quotation included is “until at last there had spring into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the Southern country.” This glorifies the KKK as an organisation created to save the Southern White people from the ‘out of control’ freed African Americans. President Woodrow Wilson reportedly remarked, "It's like writing history with lightning. My only regret is that it is all so terribly true." This endorsement of the film by the President&nbsp; of the United State reinforced the influence that The Birth of a Nation had and turned it into a tool for perpetuating racial prejudice. This further legitimised the film's racist message, therefore popularising the Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the release of The Birth of a Nation led to protests by Black individuals and associations such as the National Associations for the Advancements of Colored People (NAACP). These protests were in an effort to oppose the racist message of the movie. Despite many protests and the movie being banned in 3 states, the movie remained popular and managed to continue to reach a large audience. Southern White people, who were angered seeing the black people protest joined the Klan, this led to a massive spike in memberships following the release of the movie.<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This clearly demonstrates that the release of the movie The Birth of a Nation caused significant change and was a prominent event that caused the rise of the Second Klan.&nbsp; </b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Another significant event that revived and changed the Klan’s approach to a more violent and aggressive attitude was the start of the Civil Rights movement in the 50s and 60s and a growing resistance to racial segregation.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) made a ruling in the federal decision of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka on May 17, 1954. The SCOTUS ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional because it did not allow black children to have equal rights and protection by the law. This ruling was the first domino in the Civil Rights movement as it set a legal precedent for desegregation and legal equality. The decision infuriated many, mostly southerners, and attracted those who felt threatened by the Civil Rights movement to support and join the KKK in masses. The Ku Klux Klan was revived once again to counter integration with a more violent approach, especially in the southern states.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, the Blacks began to demand an end to the Jim Crow laws, these were laws in the south that legally allowed and supported racial discrimination and segregation. The Civil Rights movement was seen as a threat to the belief of White Supremacy that the Klan held. In response to the Civil Rights movement, the U.S Commission on Civil Rights and the authorisation of the US Attorney General to enforce voting rights was enacted into law in 1957. The group began to use increasingly violent methods to oppose and intimidate civil rights initiatives. They used methods such as lynchings, burnings, shootings and bombings to show resistance. Between 1955 and 1965, members of the KKK or Klan sympathisers carried out more than 200 bombings and the murders of 40 civil rights workers.<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly, Klan membership increased with the growth of the Civil Rights movement. With the U.S Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Klu Klux Klan members increased drastically. The bill made racial discrimination illegal in public buildings and by unions, employers and voting assemblies. This led to the Klan’s peak in membership during that time at around 40,000 members in 1965. Just nine days after the Civil Rights Act was signed into law, Lt. Colonel Lemuel Penn of the U.S Army Reserve was driving home with two other Black officers. They were spotted by 3 Ku Klux Klan members, James Lackey, Howard Sims and Cecil Myers. Enraged by the Blacks and the bill, they tail them out of town and open fire with shotguns, killing Colonel Penn. There was much more media coverage of the murder because of the added aggressiveness of the crime due to the bill just signed into law. However, both Howard Sims and Cecil Myers were acquitted by a full white jury.<br>
                      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This clearly demonstrates that the Civil Rights movement caused significant change and was a prominent crusade that caused the increased aggression and violence of the Ku Klux Klan. </b>

Many immigrants particularly from non-european countries continually faced heavy discrimination and xenophobia. This was key in the growth and the constant presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the 20th century, racism was very clearly visible and publicised. Laws and public figures openly supported it. For example, the Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the Johnson-Reed act, limited the number of immigrants allowed entry into the United States through a national origins quota. The quota specifically favoured immigrants from countries with a majority white population. This created a bias against non-european countries. These policies reflected the anti-immigrant sentiment in the US during the early 20th century. The policies reinforced the belief that an ideal America was one without immigrants. The anti-immigrant went together with the Ku Klux Klan’s ideals that promoted white supremacy. The KKK used this prejudice to their advantage and recruited people using this as a rallying point to advance its agenda of violence against immigrants and blacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, prejudice against Black people still continued through the 20th century despite the changes that the civil rights movement brought. Following the Civil Rights act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Black people still continued to face systemic racism and inequality. Racism continued in many different ways, creating many disparities in education and employment opportunities. The ongoing discrimination showed just how deep seeded the prejudice against Black people was in American life despite the efforts of the civil rights movement. The KKK played a big role in inciting violence and sustaining racism against Black people throughout the 20th century. They used violence and intimidation to maintain their ideologies of white supremacy and to resist efforts to desegregate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Ku Klux Klan played a key role in the perpetuation of anti-immigrant and anti-Black prejudices throughout the 20th century. The KKK believed in white supremacy, they targeted anyone they considered non-white, this not only included Blacks but other immigrants too. They carried out acts of terror and violence to maintain what they thought that American society should be. The KKK would not have gotten as big as it did without the prejudices that were already present in society, they just reinforced and intensified the existing racism. This created a very tough environment filled with inequalities and hate for immigrants and Blacks. The KKK worked to fight efforts to create equality. The KKK was a symbol of the continuity of prejudice against immigrants and Blacks throughout the 20th century. They spread their ideologies and perpetuated the discrimination and hate.<br>
                      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the prejudice against immigrants and black people caused the constant presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 20th century.</b>

                  <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2" data-animation-name="customAnimationIn" data-animation-duration="1000"> In conclusion, to a large extent, the Ku Klux Klan can be evaluated to demonstrate more change in the Twentieth Century as there were a lot of rise and declines of the popularity and memberships of the Ku Klux Klan. Towards the end of the 20th century, Klan membership was reduced to below 5000.</p>
