At the start of the twentieth century, many people began migrating to the US due to escaping religious, racial, and political persecution, or seeking relief from a lack of economic opportunity.</p>

                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The USA “the land of the free”’s migrants’ races were majority Europeans, WWI also persuaded many eastern Europeans to migrate to the us almost none of them were blocked from entering the country for migration whereas people such as Asians from all  over were blocked from entering the country with the immigration act of 1917 seemingly borne of disdain for the race. <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The immigration act of 1924 limited the number of migrants allowed into the us through visas issued to 2% of total people of all ethnic groups in the 1890 census, this law favored people of western and northern European descent while completely excluding immigrants from Asia with the exception of the Philippines being an American colony at the time. Being a “different” race during these times with such strict and biased laws was along the lines of being ineligible to enter America you had to go through a long process just to get in or if you were unlucky, they would take one good look at you and tell you that you weren’t allowed in the place that you spent hours to go to and a lot of money all for nothing. <br>

The Act ended the national origin quotas enacted in the 1920s. This meant that it eliminated national origin, race, and ancestry as a basis for immigration, making discriminating against obtaining visas illegal, thus increasing the amount of people entering the country and improving the treatment of immigrants.</b>

                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The early 1900s witnessed the implementation of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882, which restricted Chinese immigration, reflecting deep-seated anti-Chinese sentiment. Discrimination was further evident in the 1924 Immigration Act, which imposed nationality-based quotas, favoring immigrants from Northern and Western Europe while severely limiting those from Southern and Eastern Europe.The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act marked a shift in immigration policy, abolishing nationality-based quotas. However, discrimination still persisted as racial preferences and stereotypes persisted, especially against non-European immigrants. The Act did little to change the deep-rooted racial biases.Despite some legal reforms in the 2000s, anti-immigrant sentiment remained strong. The controversial immigration debates in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with discussions on border security, undocumented immigrants, and racial profiling, demonstrated the persistent racial prejudices against immigrants, particularly those from Latin America and the Middle East.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The evidence demonstrates the continuous presence of discrimination and racism against immigrants in America. While immigration policies evolved, they often reflected and perpetuated racial biases, and anti-immigrant sentiment persisted, particularly against non-European immigrants.This historical continuity of discrimination against immigrants highlights the enduring struggle to create a more inclusive and equitable society in the United States and the ongoing need to address issues related to racism and xenophobia, nowadays although you're not going to see people being blatantly discriminatory towards a certain race but although it isn’t blatant it’s still there, and although immigration for the masses has improved, for mexicans there is still quite a bit of trouble these days.</b><b>
