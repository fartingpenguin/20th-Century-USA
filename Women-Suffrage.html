A few examples of these events included World War 1, The 19th Amendment and the Women's Liberation movement.

These events changed society’s aspect on women as well as the number of opportunities and rights gained.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>World War 1 first started on 28 July 1914. The war was between many central powers such as Germany, Australia, France, Great Britain and the United States. On April 6, 1917, the United States, led by Woodrow Wilson decided to enter World War 1. At the time of World War 1, most women were still being considered secondary citizens compared to men. They were considered outsiders to the formal structure of political life and were not allowed to vote, hold elective office or serve on juries. Women at this time were prohibited from helping or serving in military combat. As the war started, women started to see it as an opportunity to gain rights and independence. Women then started to provide support for the military through filling up manufacturing and agricultural positions while others provided support on the front lines as nurses, drivers and doctors.&nbsp;<br></b>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The former president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Anna Howard Shaw was also a key figure in mobilising American women for the World War 1 effort.&nbsp; In April of 1917, she founded the Women’s Committee of the Council of National Defense. This committee served as an organising method for the women who wanted to serve in the war. The Women’s Land Army created by the Board of Agriculture in 1917 was also a significant organisation which brought together women to take over the jobs of men by working the fields, the soil and the orchards. This hence allowed a large number of men to join the war. Women supplied food to the military and nation during World War 1. This shows that the variety and quantity of jobs being offered to women were increasing, showing that women were allowed to participate in serving and helping the military. Approximately 23000 women were recruited to work full time on the land and soil in the Women’s Land Army. This experience during World War 1 managed to challenge society's stereotypes on women at that time and demonstrated the ability of women being able to perform a wide variety of jobs.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another incredibly important women organisation during World War 1 was the Red Cross. During World War 1, nearly 55,000 women signed up for the red cross, with more than 18,000 nurses from the red cross serving with the army at that time. One prominent example of a red cross nurse was Helen Culver Kerr. She helped to combat the 1918 epidemic and provided medical attention and service to soldiers, camps and shipyards. One the group in the Red Cross, known as the American Red Cross Motor Corps, established in February of 1918 significantly helped the military in the transportation of wounded soldiers, supplies and food. Many women in the Motor Corps were trained as auto mechanics. They provided transportation to places such as canteens, hospitals and camps. The motor corps had around 12,000 volunteers and managed to garner 3.5 million miles in total. This showed that women’s employment opportunities increased significantly beyond traditional women’s professions and how the community was starting to recognize women’s important role in the war. The Red Cross Canteen Service played a vital role in providing food, supplies and relief to soldiers throughout world war 1. These served as mobile or stationary units operated by women, offering food, beverage and frequent medical attention. By the time World War 1 ended, the Red Cross was said to have operated 700 canteens, distributed 1.5 million gallons of coffee, 15 million sandwiches and 11 million pastries and overall served food 40 million times. This was all made possible due to the 55,000 volunteers in the Red Cross at that time.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>After World War 1, the 19th amendment was passed. It was passed by congress on June 4, 1919 and made it illegal to deny the right to vote. This allowed for more than 26 million to have their citizenship affirmed. The 19th amendment played an important role in promoting reproductive rights for women as well as welcoming a new voting population of women with a system that would legalise abortion and contraception. It also allowed women to experience a significant amount of economic progress as well as allowing more women to enter better education opportunities as well as a wider variety of occupations. This was an incredibly significant event in women's history as it meant that women had finally gained suffrage, the right to vote. Overall, World War 1 marked a significant change in the public perception of women’s capabilities and roles. Their large and critical involvement in World War 1 also laid the groundwork for greater changes in women’s rights in the future. The 19th amendment showed an incredible amount of change in women’s history as American women managed to gain the right to vote as well as many other benefits such as reproductive rights and education opportunities.</b>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b style="">Another significant event that helped to significantly change women’s rights in the US&nbsp; in the 20th century was the Women’s Liberation Movement. It was a diverse social movement that occurred between the 1960s and 1970s. Its main aim was to gain equal rights and opportunities for both women and men as well as rectify and solve gender based discrimination as well as inequality. This was mainly known as the second wave of feminism. This wave wanted to fight for many things that women were treated unequally in, a few examples of these include politics, reproductive rights, workplace and family. One significant part of the Women’s Liberation movement was the publication of Betty Friedan’s book. Her book was called “the feminine mystique” Betty Friedan’s book was said to have given voice to millions of women’s frustrations with the inequality and discrimination they faced on a daily basis. The book managed to sell more than 2 million copies in the first year after it was published. This was one of the main events that sparked the Women’s Liberation Movement as well as widespread activism for gender equality and women rights. The book helped to transform public awareness and brought many women into the movement. Women then started to join with government leaders and important members to request for equal pay. In 1966, Betty Friedan joined with two women, Pauli Murray and Aileen Hernandez. These 3 women helped to form the National Organization for Women. The organisation managed to garner 1035 members by the end of its second year. The goal of this organisation was to address gender based discrimination as well as advocating for women rights. The National Organization for Women promoted feminist ideas and eliminated discrimination based on gender. Activists in the organisation dressed in vintage clothing, protested gender segregation and wanted advertisements. In July 1978, the biggest ever march for the equal rights amendment was held. Over 100,000 people dressed in purple and white marched the streets in Washington DC. The main purpose was to call for an extension to the deadline for the ratification of the Equal RIghts Amendment. This organisation also greatly helped in the field of reproductive rights. It was a vocal advocate for reproductive rights and played a significant role in fighting for the legal rights in abortion. This hence led to Roe V. Wade Supreme Court Decision. The court decision ruled that the Constitution of the United States should generally protect a right to have an abortion. This court decision helped to protect a women’s reproductive autonomy and allowed them to have the right to make choices on both their future and health. It has also allowed women to have further control over their own bodies and has overall contributed to better gender equality and women rights in the United States.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another significant event was the Women's strike for equality. This event occurred on August 6, 1970. It was to celebrate the 50 years after the passing of the 19th amendment. Around 50,000 women paraded down New York City. This event was described as “easily the largest women’s rights rally since the suffrage protests.” The activism went beyond New York as demonstrations occurred throughout the country. The Women’s strike for equality was the most successful in the aspect of gender equality in workplaces and universities. This then led to Title IX in 1972. Title IX forbid sex discrimination in any educational&nbsp; program which received federal financial assistance. Title IX also allowed for better opportunities for female athletes . It stated that all schools must provide equal opportunities to female athletes. Overall, this also led to a significant increase in the number of women athletes participating. Title IX also helped to create a more inclusive environment for women in terms of education. There was a large increase in the number of female enrollments into universities.&nbsp;<br>
                      <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the Women’s Liberation Movement and the Women’s strike for equality allowed for greater advancements and opportunities in women’s rights in terms of discrimination, abortion rights, gender equality, workplace discrimination and sports.</b>

The gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between both men and women. According to a report done by rand.org , “the reported wages of women have remained constant at approximately 59 percent of men’s wages during the twentieth century.” While the gender wage gap has narrowed over the years, women still do not earn as much as men.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another aspect that has continued is violence against women in the US. This includes domestic violence as well as sexual assault. Domestic violence during the 20th century was seen as incredibly common, it was also quite socially acceptable during those times due to men being seen as superior citizens. In 1978, the United States formed the National Coalition against domestic violence. By the 1980s, isolated cases of abuse were seen to be a national problem. Domestic violence was also said to not be taken very seriously in the 20th century. Companies also took advantage of this by making comedic advertisements which hinted on the topic of domestic violence. A few examples of companies that did this were Chase and Sanborn. It is estimated that domestic violence affects 10 million women every year in the US. According to the National Library Of Medicine, 1 in 4 women experience domestic violence.&nbsp;Another aspect is the underrepresentation in Leadership. This was a significant issue in the 20th century due to some factors. These factors include stereotypical gender roles, little role models to rely on and discrimination during hiring processes.&nbsp; Women were expected to stay at home and care for their family and husband while men were supposed to bring back money to support the family. This hence influenced the number of women political figures greatly. Discrimination during hiring processes also influenced the number of women in leadership positions. Since men were seen as smarter and superior civilians, companies often preferred men to be in leadership positions.&nbsp;</b>
                    <br>
                    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In conclusion, while there has been significant progress in women’s rights throughout the 20th century, factors like domestic violence, gender pay gap and the underrepresentation in leadership has continued throughout the 20th century.&nbsp;</b><b>
